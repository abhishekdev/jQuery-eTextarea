# jQuery eTextarea #

Version: v1.0.2, Last updated: 29/Aug/2011

jQuery eTextarea updates a normal textarea control to resize based on the text it holds. Makes it resize when the user is editing text in it. It respects the CSS max-height set on a textarea
Improves on the code of the elastic plugin and autoexpand by making it layout independent (All trackers are placed in a single container as a direct child of body). The trackers are created on the fly only when they are needed. 
So no need to clean them up when textareas are ajax refreshed.
Also supports single line textareas to emulate input textbox. and resizes even on continued keypress. The event hanlders are dynamically binded and unbinded on focus and blur events.
